# Notes
- `depth_gaussian_naive_bayes.py` and `depth_categorical_naive_bayes.py` are the newest scripts (Aug 2023). They require that you download and unzip [the cropped depth images](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P_7EUaQIMwePUTKGsv0va-nMLLGwTX5P/view?usp=drive_link) and place them in the top-level of this repository, e.g., `forktip_food_detection_cv/cropped_images`
